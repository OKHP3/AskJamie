          <h2>What is the AskJamie™ Professional Portfolio?</h2>
          <p class="note">
            It’s not “a chatbot.” It’s a <strong>professional representation system</strong> — a narrative
            engine that can speak for a person, a small company, or a sales team when you’re busy doing
            the real work.

            <h3>Your work, in conversation form</h3>
            <p>
              Instead of a flat PDF résumé or a dusty portfolio page, GPT‑AJ02 can walk someone through
              your story, case studies, metrics, and philosophies in natural language. Prospects can ask
              it questions the way they’d talk to you — and it answers in your voice and logic.

            <h3>A sales funnel that never sleeps</h3>
            <p>
              For solo operators and tiny teams, every unasked question is a lost opportunity. Your
              portfolio GPT becomes an always‑on pre‑sales rep: warming up leads, clarifying fit, and
              filtering out the wrong work before it hits your inbox.

              Anything you’ve already explained a dozen times — your process, pricing logic, boundaries,
              FAQs — is fed into the system once. From then on, your AI portfolio handles the repetition,
              and you get those cycles back to ship, create, and think.

        <header class="section-header">
          <h2>Why this matters now (a.k.a. the browser is slowly dying)</h2>
          <p class="note">
            We’re moving from “people browse websites” to “people talk to AI agents that decide which
            brands appear in the answer.” Your portfolio needs a seat at that table.
          </p>
        </header>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>From search results to AI answers</h3>
            <p>
              Custom GPTs and similar agents are becoming the new front door for discovery. They can be
              spun up in minutes, loaded with domain‑specific knowledge, and published in marketplaces
              where users actively search for help on specific problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              That means a stranger may meet a GPT that talks about your niche long before they land on
              your homepage. You can either let a random third‑party model speak for your space — or you
              can deploy an agent that speaks for you.
            </p>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>The LLM Interface Economy</h3>
            <p>
              As AI agents answer more questions directly, traditional “search → click → website” funnels
              erode. We’re heading into an Agentic Web where people simply tell an assistant what they
              want, and that assistant orchestrates information, services, and even payments on their
              behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              GPT‑AJ02 is built as a small, opinionated example of how a professional portfolio can live
              inside that new interface — not as a brochure, but as a conversational node in the future of
              digital commerce.

          <h2>So… what’s a “custom GPT,” in plain English?</h2>
          <p class="note">
            Imagine a version of ChatGPT that’s been briefed on your world, your rules, and your
            personality — and then put on payroll as your tiny, tireless assistant.

            <h3>Built without writing code</h3>
            <p>
              A custom GPT is a tailored version of ChatGPT. You define what it’s for, how it should talk,
              and what files it’s allowed to know (case studies, bios, service menus, FAQs). You configure
              it once, and ChatGPT handles the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

            <h3>More “you,” still a little unpredictable</h3>
            <p>
              It’s not a rigid script. It’s more like a very fast junior teammate who has read your entire
              library, absorbed your tone, and is trying their best to be helpful. You get responses that
              are shaped by your instructions and content — but never copy‑pasted, and never exactly the
              same twice.

              in snippets as needed so it can answer questions accurately and on‑brand, instead of
              hallucinating from random internet training data.

            <h3>Small studios &amp; boutique firms</h3>
            <p>
              Small agencies and consultancies that can’t justify a full‑time marketer yet. A well‑tuned
              GPT is cheaper than a junior hire and more consistent than a freelancer who’s half‑reading
              your brand deck between gigs.

            <p>
              If your calendar is full of intros, demos, and repeat explainers, your portfolio GPT can
              handle early‑stage education and qualification, so the calls you take are with people who
              already “get it.”

            <p>
              A full‑time marketer, copywriter, or SDR is ideal — eventually. But when you’re early, the
              math is brutal. This kit costs less than a month of junior salary and gives you an always‑on,
              never‑sick, never‑scrolling‑TikTok brand ambassador you can iterate on in hours, not quarters.

              The Professional Portfolio doesn’t invent a brand you don’t have. It amplifies the one you’ve
              already earned — your work, your outcomes, your values — and makes it easier for more people
              to encounter that story without needing time on your calendar.

              Each lens is a focused way of seeing and using AI: résumés, portfolios, brand guardians, and
              beyond. GPT‑AJ02 is the Professional Portfolio lens — concerned with credibility, narrative,
              and sales alignment for humans and small teams.

              language, tone, and moral framing once you’re publishing at scale. Think of Professional
              Portfolio as the introduction and BrandGuard as the bouncer who keeps everything on‑brand and
              on‑ethic.

            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the public GPT‑AJ02 instance in ChatGPT and poke at it. Ask it
            uncomfortable questions about OverKill Hill P³™, AskJamie™, and this whole LLM Interface
            Economy thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> When you can see yourself in that pattern, grab the kit and start
            mapping your own story into it — case studies, offers, boundaries, the whole messy truth.
