          <h2>What is the AskJamie™ Professional Portfolio?</h2>
          <p class="note">
            It’s not “a chatbot.” It’s a <strong>professional representation system</strong> — a narrative
            engine that can speak for a person, a small company, or a sales team when you’re busy doing
            the real work.

            <h3>Your work, in conversation form</h3>
            <p>
              Instead of a flat PDF résumé or a dusty portfolio page, GPT‑AJ02 can walk someone through
              your story, case studies, metrics, and philosophies in natural language. Prospects can ask
              it questions the way they’d talk to you — and it answers in your voice and logic.

            <h3>A sales funnel that never sleeps</h3>
            <p>
              For solo operators and tiny teams, every unasked question is a lost opportunity. Your
              portfolio GPT becomes an always‑on pre‑sales rep: warming up leads, clarifying fit, and
              filtering out the wrong work before it hits your inbox.

              Anything you’ve already explained a dozen times — your process, pricing logic, boundaries,
              FAQs — is fed into the system once. From then on, your AI portfolio handles the repetition,
              and you get those cycles back to ship, create, and think.

        <header class="section-header">
          <h2>Why this matters now (a.k.a. the browser is slowly dying)</h2>
          <p class="note">
            We’re moving from “people browse websites” to “people talk to AI agents that decide which
            brands appear in the answer.” Your portfolio needs a seat at that table.
          </p>

            <h3>From search results to AI answers</h3>
            <p>
              Custom GPTs and similar agents are becoming the new front door for discovery. They can be
              spun up in minutes, loaded with domain‑specific knowledge, and published in marketplaces
              where users actively search for help on specific problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              That means a stranger may meet a GPT that talks about your niche long before they land on
              your homepage. You can either let a random third‑party model speak for your space — or you
              can deploy an agent that speaks for you.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>The LLM Interface Economy</h3>
            <p>
              As AI agents answer more questions directly, traditional “search → click → website” funnels
              erode. We’re heading into an Agentic Web where people simply tell an assistant what they
              want, and that assistant orchestrates information, services, and even payments on their
              behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              GPT‑AJ02 is built as a small, opinionated example of how a professional portfolio can live
              inside that new interface — not as a brochure, but as a conversational node in the future of
              digital commerce.

          <h2>So… what’s a “custom GPT,” in plain English?</h2>
          <p class="note">
            Imagine a version of ChatGPT that’s been briefed on your world, your rules, and your
            personality — and then put on payroll as your tiny, tireless assistant.

            <h3>Built without writing code</h3>
            <p>
              A custom GPT is a tailored version of ChatGPT. You define what it’s for, how it should talk,
              and what files it’s allowed to know (case studies, bios, service menus, FAQs). You configure
              it once, and ChatGPT handles the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

            <h3>More “you,” still a little unpredictable</h3>
            <p>
              It’s not a rigid script. It’s more like a very fast junior teammate who has read your entire
              library, absorbed your tone, and is trying their best to be helpful. You get responses that
              are shaped by your instructions and content — but never copy‑pasted, and never exactly the
              same twice.

              Under the hood, the GPT uses your uploaded documents as a private reference library, pulling
              in snippets as needed so it can answer questions accurately and on‑brand, instead of
              hallucinating from random internet training data.

              Each lens is a focused way of seeing and using AI: résumés, portfolios, brand guardians, and
              beyond. GPT‑AJ02 is the Professional Portfolio lens — concerned with credibility, narrative,
              and sales alignment for humans and small teams.

            <h3>BrandGuard™ (sibling lens)</h3>
            <p>
              While this lens focuses on representing <em>you</em>, BrandGuard™ focuses on protecting your
              language, tone, and moral framing once you’re publishing at scale. Think of Professional
              Portfolio as the introduction and BrandGuard as the bouncer who keeps everything on‑brand and
              on‑ethic.

            <h3>BFS: Framing Intelligent Futures 🔨🧠</h3>
            <p>
              BFS is a deeper, more experimental study in framing and decision‑making — a future‑facing
              evolution of this portfolio concept. It’s here as inspiration, not as a SKU: a peek at how far
              you could push your own AI systems once the basics are working.

          GPT‑AJ02 exists as a <strong>storytelling artifact and working prototype</strong>: a way to show
          what’s possible when you treat a custom GPT as an interactive advocate, not a novelty bot. The
          value we deliver to you is the set of patterns, not the personality.

            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the public GPT‑AJ02 instance in ChatGPT and poke at it. Ask it
            uncomfortable questions about OverKill Hill P³™, AskJamie™, and this whole LLM Interface
            Economy thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> When you can see yourself in that pattern, grab the kit and start
            mapping your own story into it — case studies, offers, boundaries, the whole messy truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> When you get stuck or want to go further, email
            <a href="mailto:sales@overkillhill.com">sales@overkillhill.com</a> with
            <code>[Professional Portfolio]</code> in the subject line. We’ll talk about whether you need a
            nudge… or a full‑blown Future‑You AI.
