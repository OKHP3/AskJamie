            <h3>Contextual Intelligence Retrieval</h3>
            <p>
              Enterprise Sleuth doesn’t just search for keywords. It pulls timelines, exceptions, and
              relationships from across your files so answers are grounded in your reality — not generic
              internet wisdom.

            <h3>Organizational Cartography</h3>
            <p>
              Turns your organization into a map, not a maze. It learns who is connected to what, where
              information lives, and how work really flows, so you can ask “who knows this?”, “what did we
              try last time?”, or “what’s blocking this?” and get a coherent story back.

            <h3>Decision & Governance Forensics</h3>
            <p>
              Helps you trace decisions back to policies, approvals, and context. Perfect for audits,
              onboarding, and those “why did we do it this way?” conversations that usually send people
              spelunking through email threads.

          <h3>From demo GPT to repeatable recipe</h3>
          <p>
            The GPT you open in ChatGPT is tuned to OverKill Hill P³™’s own knowledge as a live example.
            The actual “product” is a package of prompts, instruction patterns, knowledge‑file structures,
            and step‑by‑step guidance that you can port into your own stack — to build a brand ambassador,
            sales agent, research assistant, governance aide, or whatever force‑multiplier you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words: you’re not buying another chatbot. You’re licensing a battle‑tested way of
            thinking about agents that’s been refined across dozens of GPTs and tens of thousands of prompt
            iterations — so our mistakes don’t have to be yours.

          <h2>What GPT‑AJ03 actually does</h2>
          <p class="note">
            Enterprise Sleuth is a lens on your data: one part detective, one part analyst, one part
            explainer. It’s designed for noisy, real‑world enterprises — not tidy demo datasets.
          </p>
        </header>

        <div class="about-grid">
          <article>
            <h3>Thinks like an investigator, not a search box</h3>
            <p>
              Classic search answers “where is this file?”. Enterprise Sleuth is built to answer “what’s
              the story here?” and “what changed over time?”. It pulls fragments from policies, project
              docs, tickets, chats, and meeting notes, then stitches them into timelines and narratives
              people can actually act on.
            </p>
            <p>
              It leans on AskJamie’s three personas — detective, analyst, teacher — to keep answers both
              useful and human. The detective hunts through the haystack. The analyst connects patterns
              and trade‑offs. The teacher explains it back in clear language so your team doesn’t have to
              be “AI people” to benefit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the hood, it’s also a prompt architecture: careful guardrails, reasoning steps, and
              sanity checks that keep the model from drifting off into hallucinations or unhelpful tangents
              as it works through complex questions.

            detailed instructions and attach files so the AI behaves like a reusable, specialized tool.
            Enterprise Sleuth is designed to map cleanly onto all of them.

            <h3>Plain‑English tour of the ecosystem</h3>
            <p>
              If you’re not living in AI blogs every day, the vocabulary gets overwhelming fast. Here’s the
              simple view:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>OpenAI Custom GPTs</strong> — your own versions of ChatGPT with saved instructions and up to
                dozens of attached files. They live inside ChatGPT and can be shared like mini‑apps.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Microsoft Copilot Studio Agents</strong> — agents you design inside Microsoft 365 so they can
                work in Teams, SharePoint, and Office. You describe what they should do and what data they
                can see, and Copilot carries it out.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Copilot Studio Lite Agents</strong> — a lighter, template‑driven way to spin up simpler
                agents quickly, often surfaced directly inside Microsoft 365 as “apps in chat.”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Google Gemini Gems</strong> — “custom experts” you define for Gemini. You give them a name,
                instructions, and a handful of reference files so they remember how you like things done.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Claude Projects & Artifacts</strong> — focused workspaces where Claude can use your uploaded
                docs plus persistent instructions, and then produce reusable outputs (artifacts) like docs,
                dashboards, or small tools.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Perplexity Spaces / Labs</strong> — project hubs where you combine deep research, your own
                uploads, and saved instructions so you can revisit and extend work over time.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Different labels, same basic pattern: a saved “personality and job description” plus a pile of
              relevant evidence. Enterprise Sleuth gives you the playbook for that pattern so you can stand
              up the same sleuth across whichever platforms your organization already pays for.
            </p>

            <h3>More controllable — never fully predictable</h3>
            <p>
              A key reality check: no custom GPT, Copilot agent, Gem, or Claude project is ever 100%
              predictable. They’re more like talented new hires: you can give them a great job description,
              a good starter pack of examples, and clear boundaries — and then you manage the relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Enterprise Sleuth approach narrows the behavior band dramatically with structured
              instructions, examples, and guardrails, but it never pretends the model is a vending machine.
              You stay in the loop. We simply make that loop faster, safer, and more consistently useful.

                Start with the same instruction skeleton (identity, mission, rules, workflow, output
                formats).
              </li>
              <li>
                Drop it into your platform of choice (Custom GPT, Copilot Studio, Gems, Claude, Perplexity).
              </li>
              <li>
                Attach your own knowledge: policies, playbooks, project archives, catalogs, or data exports.
              </li>
              <li>
                Iterate once with your team, then reuse endlessly as a branded, in‑house “AI colleague”.

          <h2>Why this beats “hire another person” or “learn it all yourself”.</h2>
          <p>
            Standing up a serious enterprise agent from scratch usually means one of two paths: hire a
            full‑time internal tinkerer and wait months or years as they experiment — or try to learn
            everything yourself, in between the job you already have.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Enterprise Sleuth recipes compress those years of trial‑and‑error into a few focused hours.
            You get: a reference GPT, a documented instruction structure, knowledge‑file patterns, example
            flows, and practical do/don’t lists based on hard‑won lessons. You keep full control of your
            data, tools, and branding.
